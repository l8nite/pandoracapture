pandoracapture
==============

A Fiddler2 extension that automatically captures Pandora mp3 files to your desktop

To use:
- compile the solution
- put the resulting dll in My Documents\Fiddler2\Scripts
- start Fiddler2
- start Pandora
- wait for files to be saved to your desktop

The files don't contain any metadata, so you may want to use Picard or a similar tool to help identify them.
A future improvement to ths project would be to look at the metadata requests to Pandora and collate them with the mp3s
